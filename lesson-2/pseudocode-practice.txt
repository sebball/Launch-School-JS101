// a function that returns the sum of two numbers 

Given two numbers
Assign the sum of these two numbers to a variable
Return this variable

START

# Given two numbers, number1 and number2

SET result = number1 + number2

PRINT result

END


// a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together 

Given an array of only strings
Make an empty string variable in the global space called stringsConcat
Iterate through the array of strings
  - for each iteration make stringsConcat = stringsConcat + the current string iteration
after iterating through the initial array return stringsConcat

START

# Given an array of strings called strings

SET newString = ""

SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of strings

  newString = newString + string at the position of iterator

  iterator += 1

PRINT newString

END



// a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other 
// element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance: 
everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]

Given an array of integers
Create an empty array called everyOther
Set an iterator variable at 0
Make a for loop that increases the iterator by 2 each time. iterator must stay below length of 
original array.
Each repetition of the loop add the number of initial array at index of the iterator to the new array everyOther

After completing the for loop return the new array everyOther





// a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string.


Given a string and desired character
Set a variable numberOfTimes to 0, representing the occurences of desired character.
Use a for loop to generate index numbers 0 to length of string - 1:
  - if the character at string position i equals desired character:
    - add one to numberOfTimes
  check if numberOfTimes equals 3:
    - return the current index number

If for loop completes without numberOfTimes reaching 3 return null





// a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. T
//the elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned
// array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.

Given two arrays of equal length
Create an empty array newArray
Make a for loop that creates index numbers from 0 to length of the arrays - 1:
  - First add element at current index from first array to newArray
  - Next add element at current index from second array to newArray

Once the loop is finished return newArray
